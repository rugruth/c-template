# c-template

This project is a template for a simple C application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Project Structure

```
projectname           # By default, the name of this folder will be the project and executable name.
├── src
│   └── main.c        # Contains the main function of the C program
├── build
│   ├── debug         # Contains CMake configuration and binaries for the debug target
│   │   └── out       # Debug build output
│   └── release       # Contains CMake configuration and binaries for the release target
│       └── out       # Release build output
├── CMakeLists.txt    # CMake configuration file
└── README.md         # Project documentation
```

## Build Directory Structure

After running the CMake configure tasks, your `build` directory will look like this:

```
build
├── debug
│   ├── CMakeFiles/         # CMake configuration files for debug
│   ├── out/                # Debug build output (executables, etc.)
│   ├── Makefile
│   └── ...                 # Other CMake-generated files
└── release
    ├── CMakeFiles/         # CMake configuration files for release
    ├── out/                # Release build output (executables, etc.)
    ├── Makefile
    └── ...                 # Other CMake-generated files
```

- All build artifacts and configuration files are kept inside the `build` folder, separated by `debug` and `release` subfolders.
- The `out` folder inside each configuration contains the resulting executables.

## Building the Project

### Configure CMake (first time or if you delete `build` folder)
1. Open the command palette (Ctrl-Shift-P)
2. Type "Run Task" and press Enter
3. From the list of tasks, run "CMake Configure (Debug & Release)". This will create the appropriate folder structure and CMake configuration files for both debug and release.

**Note:** Never leave files not generated by your project inside the `build` folder. If you use the "Clean All" task, it will delete the `build` folder and all its contents.

## Building and Running the Application

Just press F5 or click on "Run and Debug" and then the play icon. You can change the target to release, but by default the release build does not generate debug symbols; you should modify CMakeLists.txt if you need them.

### Other Useful Tasks

To see the list of available tasks:

1. Open the command palette (Ctrl-Shift-P)
2. Type "Run Task" and press Enter

Here is the list of current custom tasks and their purposes:

1. **Clean All (Delete Build Folder)** – Completely deletes the `build` folder, including all executables and CMake-generated configuration files. Never save files you want to keep inside the `build` folder.
2. **CMake Configure (Debug & Release)** – Configures both `debug` and `release` CMake targets and creates the necessary folder structure under `build`.
3. **CMake Configure (Debug)** – Same as above, but only for the `debug` target.
4. **CMake Configure (Release)** – Same as above, but only for the `release` target.
5. **Make Build (Debug)** – Runs make in the `debug` folder to build the project in debug mode.
6. **Make Build (Release)** – Runs make in the `release` folder to build the project in release mode.
7. **Run Executable (Debug)** – Runs the `debug` output executable.
8. **Run Executable (Release)** – Runs the `release` output executable.
9. **C/C++: gcc.exe build active file** – Handy for quick or simple projects. This will just compile the open editor file and generate an executable in the same folder as the source file.
